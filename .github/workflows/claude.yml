            Review this Go utility library PR for:
            - Code quality and Go best practices
            - Integration with existing packages (logging, config, db, server, temporal)
            - Error handling and context usage
            - Test coverage for new functionality
            - Documentation updates if needed
            - Security implications
            
            This is a reusable infrastructure library, so ensure:
            - APIs are intuitive and well-documented
            - New features integrate well with existing patterns
            - Breaking changes are clearly noted
