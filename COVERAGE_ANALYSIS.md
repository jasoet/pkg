### Integration Tests Strategy
- ‚úÖ Keep existing testcontainer tests for db (good coverage)
- ‚úÖ Keep temporal integration tests (68.2% coverage is solid)
- üìù Add integration tests for full server+grpc+otel stack
- üìù Add end-to-end tests for common usage patterns

### Test Tools & Mocking

**Already Available:**
- testcontainers for db integration tests ‚úÖ

## Notes

- **Complete combined coverage (unit + integration): 68.8%**
- Unit tests only: `task test` (~52.0%)
- **Integration tests:** `task test:integration` (includes db + temporal, 68.8% combined, uses testcontainers - Docker required)
- **All tests combined:** `task test:all` (same as integration, 68.8%)
- Coverage reports available in `output/` directory
- **Note:** Temporal tests now use `integration` build tag (consolidated with db tests)

## Tracking

Run these commands to check current coverage:
```bash
# ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED: Complete coverage (unit + integration)
# Requires Docker for testcontainers
task test:all
# Output: output/coverage-all.html and prints total coverage

# Unit tests only (~52.0%, no Docker required)
task test
open output/coverage.html

# Integration tests only (db + temporal, 68.8%, requires Docker)
task test:integration
open output/coverage-integration.html
```

**Recommended:** Use `task test:all` for complete coverage tracking (unit + integration) for v2.0.0 GA.

**Test Categories:**
- **Unit tests:** No build tags, no Docker required
- **Integration tests:** Build tag `integration`, Docker required (includes db + temporal testcontainers)

**Note:** All integration tests (db and temporal) now use testcontainers and require Docker to be running. Manual server management is no longer needed.
