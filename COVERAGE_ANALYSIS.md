## Recommendations for v2 Development

### Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Priority 1)
**Goal: Establish testability for core observability**

1. **Add otel package tests** ‚Üí Target: 80%+
   ```
   Files to create:

   Tools needed:
   - Mock OTel providers (in-memory for testing)
   ```

2. **Add db package unit tests** ‚Üí Target: 60%+
   ```
   Files to create:
   - db/migrations_test.go
   - db/pool_unit_test.go (separate from integration tests)

   Coverage areas:
   - Migration setup and execution (mocked)
   - Pool creation with various configs
   - Error handling for invalid configs
   - OTel callback registration

   Tools needed:
   - sqlmock for database mocking
   - Mock OTel providers
   ```

3. **Add ssh package tests** ‚Üí Target: 70%+
   ```

### Phase 2: Middleware & Integration (Priority 2)
**Goal: Test HTTP/gRPC middleware and lifecycle**

4. **Improve server package** ‚Üí Target: 70%+
   ```
   Add to server/server_test.go:
   - Middleware creation tests
   - Server lifecycle (start/stop)
   - Graceful shutdown scenarios
   - OTel integration end-to-end

   Tools:
   - httptest for testing middleware
   - Mock OTel providers
   ```

5. **Improve rest package** ‚Üí Target: 70%+
   ```
   Add to rest/client_test.go:
   - OTel middleware tests
   - Request tracing propagation
   - Error handling with traces
   - Retry logic with telemetry

   Tools:
   - httptest for mock servers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Priority
1. **otel** - Foundation for all observability (affects 6 packages)
2. **db** - Critical for data access (most projects need this)
3. **ssh** - Security-critical, must be tested
4. **server/rest/grpc** - HTTP/RPC middleware (high usage)

### Integration Tests Strategy
- ‚úÖ Keep existing testcontainer tests for db (good coverage)
- ‚úÖ Keep temporal integration tests (68.2% coverage is solid)
- üìù Add integration tests for full server+grpc+otel stack
- üìù Add end-to-end tests for common usage patterns

### Test Tools & Mocking

**Already Available:**
- testcontainers for db integration tests ‚úÖ
- httptest for HTTP testing ‚úÖ

**Need to Add:**
- OTel mock providers (critical for otel, server, rest, grpc, db)
- sqlmock for db unit tests
- SSH mock/test server for ssh package
- gRPC test utilities
