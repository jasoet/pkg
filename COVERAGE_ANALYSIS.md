3. **ssh** - Security-critical, must be tested
4. **server/rest/grpc** - HTTP/RPC middleware (high usage)

### Integration Tests Strategy
- ‚úÖ Keep existing testcontainer tests for db (good coverage)
- ‚úÖ Keep temporal integration tests (68.2% coverage is solid)
- üìù Add integration tests for full server+grpc+otel stack
- üìù Add end-to-end tests for common usage patterns

### Test Tools & Mocking

**Already Available:**
- testcontainers for db integration tests ‚úÖ
- httptest for HTTP testing ‚úÖ

**Need to Add:**
- OTel mock providers (critical for otel, server, rest, grpc, db)
- sqlmock for db unit tests
- SSH mock/test server for ssh package
- gRPC test utilities

- [ ] Add integration tests for full stack
- [ ] Document testing patterns for contributors
- [ ] Set up coverage requirements in CI/CD

## Notes

- All coverage measurements from: `task test` (unit tests only)
- Integration tests (`task test:integration`) increase db to 30.4%
- Temporal tests (`task test:temporal`) show 86.4% coverage
- Coverage reports available in `output/coverage.html`

## Tracking

Run these commands to check current coverage:
```bash
# Unit tests only (~51.5%)
task test
open output/coverage.html

# Combined unit + integration tests (53.3%)
export GOFLAGS="-mod=mod" && go test -tags=integration -cover -coverprofile=/tmp/coverage_all.out ./...
go tool cover -func=/tmp/coverage_all.out | grep total
go tool cover -html=/tmp/coverage_all.out -o /tmp/coverage_combined.html
open /tmp/coverage_combined.html

# Integration tests only
task test:integration
open output/coverage-integration.html

# Temporal tests (requires temporal server)
task test:temporal

# View coverage summary
go tool cover -func=output/coverage.out | grep total
```

**Recommended:** Use combined coverage metrics (unit + integration) for v2.0.0 GA tracking.
