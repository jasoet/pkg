## 🔧 Infrastructure Improvements

### Taskfile.yml Cleanup
- ✅ Removed obsolete `temporal:start` task
- ✅ Removed obsolete `temporal:stop` task
- ✅ Removed obsolete `temporal:status` task
- ✅ Removed obsolete `temporal:logs` task

**Reason**: Integration tests now use **testcontainers** exclusively (except Argo which requires k8s cluster). Manual temporal tasks were only for local development and are no longer needed.

### Test Quality Improvements
- ✅ Fixed race conditions using `atomic.Bool`
- ✅ All tests pass with `-race` detector
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage
- ✅ Proper error handling tests
- ✅ Resource cleanup verification

## 📌 Notes

### Why Some Functions Have Low Coverage

**server/server.go: Start() and StartWithConfig()**
- **0% coverage** - These are blocking signal handlers that wait for OS signals
- Cannot be unit tested without complex signal mocking
- Core functionality is tested through `newHttpServer()` and `start()/stop()`
- Production behavior verified through integration tests

**server/server.go: start()**
- **66.7% coverage** - Partial coverage due to goroutine timing
- Main execution path fully tested
- Edge cases in server startup hard to reproduce in unit tests

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **db package (27.8%)** - Add comprehensive database tests
2. **ssh package (23.3%)** - Add SSH operation tests

### Medium Priority
3. **temporal package (0.0%)** - Integration tests using testcontainers

### Low Priority (Already Excellent)
- Most packages >80% coverage ✅
- Critical business logic well-tested ✅
- Core infrastructure thoroughly validated ✅
